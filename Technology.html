        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Like a gentle breeze carrying the whispers of nature, our safety features provide unobtrusive
            yet essential protection. From fire alarms to flood sensors, your home remains a sanctuary,
            always ready to respond.
        </p>

        <h3>Fire Alarm & Water</h3>
        <p>Equipped with warning lights, voice, alarms, and conceled water systems, the fire system
            instantly detects and suppresses fires with pre-loaded water reserves hidden in your
            ceilings and walls. At the first sign of smoke or fire, the fire system activates a
            multi-sensory alarm system, flashing warning lights and issuing clear voice alerts
            to ensure immediate awareness. Hidden within your ceiling and walls are pre-charged water
            reserves, ready to deploy automatically. These concealed sprinklers release a controlled
            water spray to douse flames, preventing the spread of fire and minimizing damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Water Rats</h3>
        <p>Upon detecting smoke or heat, intelligent robots disguised
            as rats, emerge from hidden compartments and swiftly release powerful streams of water
            from their bult-in water pistols. Their precise aim targets the fire directly, extinguishing
            flames before they are spread. Designed to move through narrow spaces and reach high-risk
            areas, these robotic defenders ensure rapid, efficient fire control without causing unnecessary
            water damage.</p>

        <h3>Robots</h3>
        <p>Safeguard your home with an innovative fire supression system that activates in seconds.
            When a fire is detected, faucet-like mouth robots spring to life, spraying a specially formulated
            green fire retardant. This eco-friendly solution smothers flames on contact, reducing the spread
            of fire while minimizing damage to your home. These robots are strategically placed throughout
            your attic trapdoors and ceilings, ensuring they can reach any area at risk.
