            <h4>Fire Alarm & Water</h4>
            <p>
              Equipped with warning lights, voice, alarms, and concealed water
              systems, the fire system instantly detects and suppresses fires
              with pre-loaded water reserves hidden in your ceilings and walls.
              At the first sign of smoke or fire, the fire system activates a
              multi-sensory alarm system, flashing warning lights and issuing
              clear voice alerts to ensure immediate awareness. Hidden within
              your ceiling and walls are pre-charged water reserves, ready to
              deploy automatically. These concealed sprinklers release a
              controlled water spray to douse flames, preventing the spread of
              fire and minimizing damage.

            <h4>Water Rats</h4>
            <p>
              Upon detecting smoke or heat, intelligent robots disguised as
              rats, emerge from hidden compartments and swiftly release powerful
              streams of water from their built-in water pistols. Their precise
              aim targets the fire directly, extinguishing flames before they
              are spread. Designed to move through narrow spaces and reach
              high-risk areas, these robotic defenders ensure rapid, efficient
              fire control without causing unnecessary water damage.

              Safeguard your home with an innovative fire suppression system
              that activates in seconds. When a fire is detected, faucet-like
              mouth robots spring to life, spraying a specially formulated green
              fire retardant. This Eco-friendly solution smothers flames on
              contact, reducing the spread of fire while minimizing damage to
              your home. These robots are strategically placed throughout your
              attic trapdoors and ceilings, ensuring they can reach any area at
              risk.
