              The nursery's standout feature is its interactive glass walls,

              high-definition screens can display a variety of calming and

              animations, enhancing your baby's visual stimulation. The images

            <h4>Aromatic System</h4>
            <p>
              The nursery also has an aromatic system that synchronizes scents
              with the displayed images. For instance, if the image is of a
              forest, the system might release subtle, fresh pine or earthy
              scents; if it's a beach scene, the aroma might be of sea breeze or
              coconut. This harmony between sight and smell creates a fully
              immersive sensory experience, promoting relaxation and
              exploration.
